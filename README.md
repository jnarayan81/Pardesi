Exploring Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) or lateral gene transfer (LGT) 

What is HGT or LGT?

Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) or lateral gene transfer (LGT) is the movement of genetic material between unicellular and/or multicellular organisms other than by the ("vertical") transmission of DNA from parent to offspring. HGT is an important factor in the evolution of many organisms.
